"""Hydrate GEO-INFER manuscript variables before every render.

The docxology template looks for exactly this path — ``scripts/
z_generate_manuscript_variables.py`` — in
:func:`infrastructure.rendering._manuscript_source.run_manuscript_variable_script`,
and when it is absent that function returns ``0`` with no log line, which the
pipeline reads as "hydrated OK".  GEO-INFER's generator lives at
``manuscript/generate_research_artifacts.py``, a path the template never looks
for, so the manuscript's own invariant — "changing values must enter the
manuscript through the generator" — was enforced by human discipline alone and
``stage_03_render.py --project GEO-INFER`` would publish whatever happened to
be on disk and exit 0.

This shim closes that gap.  Every render now regenerates the evidence bundle
and then re-checks it, so a render either produces current values or fails.

Modes:
    default
        Regenerate from the working tree.  An unclean checkout is permitted
        but is stamped ``<sha>-dirty`` and its uncommitted-entry count is
        published as ``RESEARCH_TREE_DIRTY_FILE_COUNT`` — a render during
        ordinary development must work, but it must not claim to be a clean
        commit.  This mode runs no verification command, but it does not
        destroy the record of commands that did run: a stored record naming
        this source hash, commit, and tier is reused and republished, and a
        record describing a different tree is carried forward with its own
        provenance rather than replaced.  Without that, every
        default render — which is what ``stage_03_render.py --project
        GEO-INFER`` performs — would overwrite the evidence bundle with an
        empty one and publish ``not run``.
    ``GEO_INFER_MANUSCRIPT_VERIFY=1``
        Evidence build.  Publishes a real per-group record instead of an empty
        one.  A stored record is reused when it names the same source hash,
        commit, and tier; otherwise the commands run here, which can exceed the
        renderer's bounded hydration timeout — pre-run
        ``python manuscript/generate_research_artifacts.py --verify`` on a
        clean tree first.  A failing group is published with its return code
        and does not abort the render; only a publication build refuses.  The
        run is widened to cover every group the stored record already holds,
        because replacing an eleven-group record with a seven-group one would
        delete measured outcomes this build never re-ran.
    ``GEO_INFER_MANUSCRIPT_FULL_VALIDATION=1``
        Request the second tier of command groups without asking for a
        publication build.  It selects which commands a verifying build
        *runs*; it does not select the denominator the manuscript publishes
        against.  That denominator is read from the record itself — from the
        tier its results were measured at — so a render that republishes an
        eleven-group record publishes eleven defined groups whether or not
        this variable is set.  It used to be the only thing standing between
        the shipped abstract and an impossible ``9 of 7``, which made a
        correct build depend on an operator remembering an environment
        variable.  It does not relax ``--publication``: a build that carries
        a failed group is still refused when publication is requested.
    ``GEO_INFER_MANUSCRIPT_PUBLICATION=1``
        Publication build.  Requires a clean checkout, a non-empty verification
        record with no failures, and runs the full validation suite.

Runs standalone as well: ``python scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py``.
