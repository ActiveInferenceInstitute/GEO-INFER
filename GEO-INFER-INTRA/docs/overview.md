# GEO-INFER Framework Overview

GEO-INFER is a 45-module Python 3.11+ workspace for geospatial analysis,
probabilistic inference, Active Inference, domain workflows, applications, and
repository validation. It treats spatial systems as data-rich processes whose
states, uncertainty, observations, and decisions can be analyzed together.

## What the framework provides

- **Spatial representation** through H3 v4, CRS-aware geometry, indexing, and
  backend dispatch.
- **Temporal representation** through time-series alignment, forecasting, and
  temporal features.
- **Inference** through mathematical utilities, Bayesian models, spatial
  statistics, and the canonical ACT Active Inference implementation.
- **Decision and simulation** through agent coordination, swarm optimization,
  scenario execution, and domain-specific action models.
- **Delivery surfaces** through APIs, dashboards, visualization, communication,
  security, and operations modules.
- **Release evidence** through strict repository, test, model, skill, source,
  and H3 contract validators.

Not every workflow uses every stage. Choose the module that owns the behavior,
then use public exports and explicit cross-module adapters.

root [README module index](../../README.md#module-index) for live inventories.

## Cross-cutting contracts

### Coordinates and H3

H3 boundaries use WGS84 latitude/longitude degrees in (lat, lng) order.
Projected coordinates must be transformed before H3 indexing or metric
operations. The supported H3 package range is h3>=4.5.0,<5.

### Inference and numerical results

Probability vectors and matrices must be finite, non-negative, and normalized
where the API requires probabilities. Covariance and precision updates must
remain finite and symmetric. Stochastic paths accept local seeds when
reproducibility is required.

### Artifacts

Scenario and visualization writers must create their configured output
directories, keep outputs out of the repository root, and provide machine-readable
sidecars or manifests when the validator requires them.

### Documentation

Root and module README/AGENTS files are generated signposts.
Conceptual guidance lives in INTRA docs; executable claims should be backed by
source, tests, or a validator command.
