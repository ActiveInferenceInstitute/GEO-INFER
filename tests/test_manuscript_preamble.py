"""The preamble file is executable input, not documentation with examples.

``infrastructure/rendering/_pdf_latex_helpers.extract_preamble`` concatenates
*every* ```latex block in ``manuscript/preamble.md`` and injects the result
immediately before ``\\begin{document}``.  The file also carries the rationale
for each setting, so it is natural to paste an illustrative LaTeX document into
it — and a fence that says ``latex`` puts ``\\documentclass`` and
``\\begin{document}`` into the preamble of the real build.  These tests hold
the fenced blocks to what a preamble may contain.
